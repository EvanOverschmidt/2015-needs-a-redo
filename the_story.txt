Once upon a time


The mean professor, who is a Beaman Monster, made a class redo a homework exercise

 The professor made them redo the assignment because of a craxy Devil Bird threatened him to do so.
The professor was actually a sea serpent.
The hero of this story is nowhere to be found
So the class organized a massive search party to find the hero to slay this Beaman Monster posing as the professor
Suddenly, the hero came across an ahool!
Then Jake redid his assignment while watching Ip Man.
It's a cool movie if you're in the mood.
Then more and more students, who were really Andean Wolves, began fixing their assignments.
Everyone joined in and watched the movie.
tragically, the ahool met its untimely end.

Randomly, a kappa came out of nowhere demanding 3.50 and disappeared.
The air cooled and thunder rumbled; the students were afraid.
But the Kappa hand't dissapeared, it had instead turned into a rustacean from the protozoic era.
The transformed Kappa skittered away as all of its protozoic brothers have long since passed.
Many wondered if this would be the last time that we would see the kappa, but the world may never know.

Just then a group of ninjas burst in, all of whom were masters of shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style.
"We're here to bring the ruckus!" they shouted.
But still the hero of the story was nowhere to be found.
The ninjas had pet sea serpents.
These sea serpents were also cyborgs as well as being ninjas.
The ninjas walked away. All the students finished Ip Man and started watching Ong Bak 2
But since Ong Bak 2 sucked so bad, they hopped on their unicorn to attack an Atti

Kappy came back, this time he meant business! And died.
But they suddenly realized they had forgotten something important!They had forgotten their most important task, the dreaded SWE Exercise 2 was due in mere minutes...

After completing the exercise and finishing Ong Bak 2, they settled down on their couch to read the news.
The leading story this night was about the Chupacabra from Puerto Rico and its recent invasion of and killing the goats of Columbia, MO.

JSightings of exotic big cats in Australia began more than 100 years ago..he New South Wales State Government reported in 2003 that it was more likely than not that there was a colony of exotic big cats living in the bush near Sydney.

Several students, who wanted to help protect the livestocks, consulted the Beaman Monster professor.
The knowledgable professor then indicated that only one creature, the Ozark Howler, could defeat the the goat suckers.
The professor then rememberd that the majestic 'Ahool' could defeat the goat suckers as wellAfter remembering this very important fact, the professor took flight on his Ahool into the darkness to try and find the goat suckers!

Suddenly a Man-Eating Tree appeared and said to all of the students of CS 4320:
'This story makes no sense. Can we try again?' and began to tell the tale of his pet Malaysian Tiger, Tony.

Tony had once saved him from a rabid Moa.
The Moa believed the man-eating tree to have been a snack.

 Tony had a girlfriend that was called a Globster.

The Beast of Exmoor appeared, snarling at the Bigfoot.the Bigfoot pleaded for assistance to his supposed friend, a Wolpertinger whom he had met in Germany two years prior, but the Wolpertinger simply stared.And thus, the Bigfoot became the first confirmed meal for the Beast of Exmoor.The Beast, however, was now faced with the most menacing foe it was ever destined to face, a cold, soulless monster with no comprehension of mercy - the Wolpertinger!
Normally Wolpertinger populations were kept under control by its natural predator, the Hoop Snake.But this season, Wolpertinger populations were at an all time high as the Hoop Snakes and Chupacabras were still hibernating.The Wolpertinger turned and looked at Tony and became jealous that Tony was dating Globster. Tony grabbed Globster and started to run after what he saw the Wolpertinger do to Bigfoot. The Yeti came storming through the woods and grabbed the campers. Unfortunately, Tony turned out to be fairly slow despite being a tiger, the years of captivity had taken his speed out of him. But let us not forget, Tony was still a tiger, and one of the fiercest of them all.Linus creeped through the woods, and stumbled upon the Yeti roasting the campers on the fire.
Linus wanted Yeti to share with him. But Yeti refused.
Linus asked Yeti why he didn't agree. Yeti said he felt sad about the football game!

Suddenly something happen and seems like not good,He quickly become very nervous.

 And then he realized that was a Kappa rather than an Exmoor.
He decided to go other places to take a break.


There was once a Popobawa named Jim. He was insecure about the size of his ears and the shape of his feet. There was also a black kanagroo who was his friend.  They would play checkers every week together. This left Linus and the undead kappa alone in the woods. Suddenly, they were surrounded by hundreds of man-eating trees, all of whom were quite confused by the obfuscated story being spun.
The kangaroo wakes the great wizard that was napping in the forest.The wizard  decides to go back to sleep after seeing a giant vampire bat hovering over him,  and has decided to fight evil another day.
The end.
